### Diabetes patient prediction using (SVC) algorithm

#### Problem Statement
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

#### About Dataset
This dataset is originally from Kaggle.The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, glucose level and so on.

#### Steps Followed:
- Data Analysis: Performed various operations to get more information about the data
- Data Standardization: Data had a lot variation, so to create a consistency and to make the business easy i standardized the data.
- Machine Learning: Developed SVC machine learning models and obtained train data accuracy of 78% and test data accuracy of 72%. 
- Predictive Analysis: I used Prediction analysis to predict whether any patient is diabetic or not.
